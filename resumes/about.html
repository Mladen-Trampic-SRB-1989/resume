## Visual Workflow


![Logo Take this from dotcore](./content/cv_doc.jpg)

### Background

This CV came as an idea while I was studying YAML syntax and Ansible, for one of the previous projects. Apache Metron[1] was the framework that I needed to study, and in particular Ansible[2] playbooks in charge for deployment of this framework.
As I am big fan of automation, and since I never focused on making my CV, I have decided to make one and learn few things in process. Hope you will find my CV interesting.

### Workflow explained

Simply put, this CV is an simple example of "DIY" Continuous Delivery, whose workflow starts from [https://github.com/Mladen-Trampic-SRB-1989/resume/blob/master/resumes/mladen_trampic.yaml](https://github.com/Mladen-Trampic-SRB-1989/resume/blob/master/resumes/mladen_trampic.yaml) file. Thanks to the integration of DockerHub with GitHub[3], it is possible to configure and integrate these two tools through several simple configuration steps. In a way that DockerHub "Monitor" the GitHub repository, by tracking changes to the source code. When new code has been pushed to the master branch of the repository, DockerHub starts the build process, which is documented in the file https://github.com/Mladen-Trampic-SRB-1989/resume/blob/master/Dockerfile. The result of this "build" is a modified nginx docker container, which on launch listens on port 80, and hosts a static web page (html, compiled from YAML). However, Workflow does not end with the build of the Docker Container, because it needs to be delivered to the end-server. In this case, this was accomplished with the DockerHub WebHook[4]. At the final destination, there is a CentOS 7 linux server, with Docker Engine installed, and a simple Python REST application that runs on a specific port, using an HTTPS protocol (self signed certificate). After successful WebHook Authentication and POST call, python application will run the bash script deploy_container.sh. And the script will stop the current version of the contras and refresh image with new one from DockerHub repository.

```Bash
#!/bin/bash
# Contents of deploy_container.sh

IMAGE = 'mtrampic / resume'
docker ps | grep $ IMAGE | awk '{print $ 1}' | xargs docker stop
docker pull $ IMAGE
docker run -d -p 80:80 $ IMAGE
```

For the maintenance / upkeep of the Python application, there is a systemd configuration [5][6].

```Bash
# Contents of: /etc/systemd/system/docker_deploy_application.service
[Unit]
Description=docker-deployer
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=idle
PIDFile=/var/run/docker-deployer.pid
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/usr/local/bin/docker-deployer -c /home/trampic/deploy_container.sh >> /home/trampic/docker-deployer.log 2>&1 '
ExecStartPost=/bin/sh -c 'umask 022; systemctl status docker-deployer | grep -w \'Main PID:\' | grep -v \'/var/run/docker-deployer.pid\' | grep -v \'grep -w\' | awk \'{print $3}\'> /var/run/docker-deployer.pid'
